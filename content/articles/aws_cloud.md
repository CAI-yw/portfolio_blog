After a few months of preparation, I passed the exam and earned the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.

In my current AnimalAlert web application, I integrated Amazon S3 to allow users to upload photos and view images posted by other users.

In the future, I look forward to using additional AWS services in both personal projects and professional settings.
